// VARIABLES IN JAVASCRIPT
// Used to store values like container.
// const cannot change it's value after declaration.
// let and var are also used to store some value.
// Tip : try to use const variable most and use let variable, Over var as a best practise.

const userId = 10001 ; //(userId = this type of naming is also called camel-casing)
let userEmail = 'xyz@gmail.com';
var userCity = "Jaipur"

console.table([userId,userEmail,userCity]);
